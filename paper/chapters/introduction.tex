Reproducibility is a core part of conducting scientific research, which could be in a crisis according to different scientists, described in a survey by Nature.
The majority of the researchers who participated see a reproducibility crisis and have failed to reproduce the experiments of others.\autocite{crisis}

To make a contribution to the meaning of reproducibility, this paper documents the approach of reproducing current research about deep \ac{RL} with \ac{VQ-DQN} by Franz et al.\autocite{instabilities}, which finds instabilities in the usage of \ac{VQ-DQN}, making reproducibility attempts difficult.
